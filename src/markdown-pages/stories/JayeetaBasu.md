### Official Story
Between 1999-2002, Jayeeta went to Presidency College, Calcutta one of the country's oldest institutions of western education, to earn her bachelors degree in Physiology. In 2004, she got a Masters in Neuroscience at Georg August University, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Dr. Erwin Neher and Dr. Christian Rosenmund. Jayeeta's PhD from Baylor College of Medicine, Houston with Christian Rosenmund focused on molecular mechanisms of synaptic vesicle release. In 2007, Jayeeta started her postdoc with Dr. Steven Siegelbaum at Columbia University and worked on inhibitory circuitry and their role in plasticity, learning and memory. She has been running her lab at the NYU Neuroscience Institute since January 2015.

### Unofficial Story
In college, Jayeeta was heavily involved in politics, holding an elected office for the Independents Consolidation party on campus. She spent a lot of her college days writing for local newspapers about neuroscience, academia and discussing politics and the environment. 6 months into her PhD, Jayeeta's PhD advisor decided to move the lab from Germany to Baylor College of Medicine Houston. She was encouraged by the program to switch labs but decided against their advice. She transferred to the Baylor College of Medicine and got her PhD from there in 2007. The first year of Jayeeta's post-doc was extremely difficult as her first project failed, she couldn't reproduce her predecessor's data, and her mentor wouldn't believe her results. Eventually Jayeeta was able to prove her results and take the project in a completely different direction. In 2014, when Jayeeta was almost about to accept a faculty position in the pacific northwest, Gord gave a talk at Columbia and at the post-doc student lunch asked Jayeeta to apply to NYU.
